                                every Zipcon is held near Lunar New Year. She could plug my shi, and I could start
                                gaining traction without having to manually search internet ppls. Maybe in the next
                                couple of years, I‚Äôd have my own panel at Zipcon to show off my indie game + web

                honestly asking about that poster wouldve prob been the way to ask if she‚Äôs viet if wasn‚Äôt too afraid
                and just tried ‚Ä¶ anyway after the artist alley chabangs parosing i kinda just wanted to go home,,
                there‚Äôs always next year to at least say hi and see her again to be less of a stranger ig..(or the later
                years when Im ready to fully be an artist ‚ò†Ô∏è) if even the chance she still happens to be into setting a
                boothe up next zipcon

                there was more panels i wanted to go to

                particular this perfomance one because I found out the girl that sits next to me in speech class is a
                really cool cosplayer idol and being there wouldve been the moment we both get to meet each other as
                anime fans in the right setting

                i only had a hint she mightve been since in the icebreaker of d00m we had to introduce our partner so
                she told me general interest of watchin anime and netflix but nun too deep

                unfortuately the icebreaker speech was delayed because of a snowday and then the prof took a day off

                and then after that class, there were other school holidays to now she stopped showing up

                (to be fair i stopped going to because attendance not mandatory loll)

                but i prob just missed out, there prob goes my chance at getting help doing makeup and cosplay outfit
                help from a professional cosplayer, and for next year I could have someone readily nearby Akron to help
                me find a group to go to zipcon with so I dont walk in the cold snow alone again. (it is what it is)

                maybe i scared her off from going to that speech again, maybe its true that people be

                i could sorta feel class because üóø

                the whole time in that class i honestly just put the whole class on mute so i could do planning and
                coding for the data structures class right after (which here at Akron is not even a percent of challenge
                that was foundations 2,
                just turn in work at the last minute with chatgpt and get an A even if the assignment literally looks
                like its directly a product of chatgpt-ism, the professors rmp says it all üíÄ

                    title="Akron bruh moment" style="max-width: 400px;">

                its sorta un-justified because the prof is very nice and patient with the people in his class but Akron
                kinda dumped a work load of teaching 5 different classes from CS1 to fullstack programming so i kinda
                see where the disorginization and last minute notice are from

                im still waiting for him to announce when the next weekly inclass quiz is bc the first and only one was
                in january and i really want to message him and see if i could just take in online.

                the class is literally free but i didnt want to accept that until now

                and now when i have more patience to not be üóø and try making small talk in speech class the opportunity
                left and its late now that its almost march.



                It just sucks I was one sign off in letter grade to meet the minimum passing grade in foundations 2
                (during pandemic era also) so that i dont have to waste effort in repeating datastrucre algorithms as a
                tentative class‚Ä¶
